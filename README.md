# Real-Time Scam Call Detection

### A cutting-edge project to detect scam callers in real-time.

---

## Introduction

Tired of scam calls slipping through? Our **Real-Time Scam Call Detection** system takes call screening to the next level by detecting scams *in real-time*, no matter the phone number. Unlike other services (looking at you, Truecaller), which rely on user reports to flag a number, our solution analyzes conversations as they happen, providing instant scam detection.

## How It Works

Our system is built with a **Python Flask backend** and a **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend** for a smooth and intuitive user interface. The real magic happens in the backend where we process the call data in real-time and analyze it for scam-related patterns.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Detection**: Calls are monitored and analyzed as they happen. No need for user reports or pre-marked numbers.
- **Dynamic Scam Detection**: Works with any number, even those not previously flagged as spam or scam.
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily deployable on Android devices as an extension.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Real-Time Processing**: Custom algorithms designed to detect scam calls during the conversation

## Why Is This Different?

Unlike other call screening services that rely on a database of flagged numbers, this project takes a more proactive approach. Even if a number hasnâ€™t been reported as spam, our system can still detect a scam in real-time by analyzing the conversation and identifying red flags. This ensures you're always protected, no matter who's calling.
